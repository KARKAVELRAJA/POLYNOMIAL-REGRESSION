# POLYNOMIAL-REGRESSION

### IMPLEMENTION OF POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION USING SCIKIT-LEARN PYTHON LIBRARY TO PREDICT SALARY

- Polynomial Regression is a regression algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent and independent variable as nth degree polynomial
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processed using the POLYNOMIAL FEATURES
- Then, by using LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL from scikit-learn python library, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the output is predicted
